I stumbled upon isopod keeping and though
"holy crap that's cool"... and much easier than
antkeeping!

The next day I set out into the woods to take a stab
at it myself, and {{ page.title }} was born! While the
isopods in this terrarium are not actually Pill Bugs,
I like the name Pillville. I believe they may be Common Shiny Woodlouse,
but I'm not 100% sure.
