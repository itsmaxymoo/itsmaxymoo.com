Writing this two years after the fact, this was my first (and still favorite) time
climbing New Hampshire's infamous Mount Washington! I slept at a rest stop near
the VT-NH border the night before to allow me to get to Washington as fast as
possible. The route I chose was the Ammonoosuc trail, mainly to avoid large
crowds and maximize my chances of finding parking. I arrived and promptly started
at 5:30 AM.

The trail was rocky, but manageable. It followed the Ammonoosuc River for a long
while which made for a spectacular, cool view. It also allowed me to drink water
liberally and filter more from the river as I went. It took about two hours
to reach the Lake of the Clouds Hut. Up to this point, the hike had been easier
than expected. I paused for a while to enjoy the view. Looking towards Monroe and
consulting my map, I felt I had the energy to add in Mount Monroe before summiting
Washington. It turns out I did, because the trail up Monroe was a quick, fun,
and breathtakingly gorgeous route!

After turning back and crossing the boulder field, I set forth to summit Washington!
Elevation wise, climbing from the Lake of the Clouds to the summit of Washington is
similar to Elk Mountain in Pennsylvania. Of course, the terrain is significantly more
technical and dangerous! After another hour, I made it to the top! Luckily, the mountain
gods blessed me with clear weather, a real rarity in the Presidentials!

I made the quick jaunt over to Clay before descending the Jewell trail and driving home.
By the time I reached Clay, the range had been overtaken by clouds from the west, leaving
little reason to linger at the top.
