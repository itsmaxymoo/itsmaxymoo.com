After two weeks of the jar looking like black sludge,
I am declaring this jar "dormant". There are no signs of life.
The duckweed is a gray green shade, the soil has red spots in it,
and there is nothing moving. I will give this jar until Thanksgiving to
turn itself around. If not, it may just die!
