I am heartbroken to announce that the Alpha Colony
has died. I cannot believe how much this hurts to witness,
especially because it happened so fast. Yesterday when I went
to feed them normally, I noticed the queen was laying on her side
and the workers were acting slow and lethargic. Today, the queen
was missing an antenna and several workers were dead in the outer
world. All but two of the workers inside the test tube were dead.
I will continue to feed them until they die naturally, but the
colony is dead.

This hit me like a kick in the stomach. I don't know for sure what could have
caused this to happen so suddenly. I have three theories:

1. Stress from last week's tube transfer
2. I did not properly clean the new test tube (failure to wash
out rubbing alcohol, they choke)
3. My dorm was sprayed with something recently. But this is unlikely
because we currently have a small-scale ant infestation going on as well.

The two leading theories suggest it is my error :(

The Alpha Colony will always live on fondly in my memories
as my first ever ant colony. I loved to watch the workers go
about their duties and care for the queen, and looked forward to
their weekly feeding session. Rest in peace.
