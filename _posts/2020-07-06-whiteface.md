Writing this two years after the fact, this was my first time ever
climbing a serious mountain. Previously, my only experience hiking
had been around Pennsylvania. Unsurprisingly, I was not expecting
the difficulty and rigor commonly found in the Adirondacks!

I set out in my 2002 Subaru Outback with three nearly bald tires
for Lake Placid, NY. My plan for the week was to hit up the daks,
meander over to New Hampshire, and finish by climbing Mount
Washington... Eating only Cliff Bars.

I parked at the Connery Pond Landing trail head, and arrived
shortly at the northeast shore of Lake Placid. From there, the
trail got progressively more technical and steep. The trail runs up
a creek bed at one point, which had me lost for the first time in
my life. Luckily, OsmAnd gave me my orientation pretty quickly.
Two or so hours later, I made it to the top! At the time, it was
the most breathtaking view I had even seen!

I made it back down the mountain and drove to a nearby
lot to sleep the night. The next day, I had planned to climb
Gothics via Lower Ausable Lake. Unfortunately, this would be the way I
learned a hard lesson about proper nutrition and rest; I simply
could not make it. I summited Indian Head and made it to
Rainbow Falls, but had to call it a day there. I was too wiped even
to continue to New Hampshire. I went home.

Despite the disappointing end, I had an absolute blast and learned
a lot from this trip. It fueled my love for hiking and paved the way
for me to conquer more challenging mountains in the future!
