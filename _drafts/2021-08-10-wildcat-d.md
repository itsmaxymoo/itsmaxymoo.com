The day started with a planning conflict during a family trip
to Lincoln, NH. They wanted to be touristy; I wanted to climb
a mountain. The only issue was that we all had tickets for the
Cannon Mountain cable car; whatever I did had to be fast.
Consulting my map, Wildcat D seemed like an appropriate hike.

I arrived to the trailhead at noon and wasted no time starting
up the mountain. The trail wasted no time, either! I had to scramble
up in order to meet my time deadline, so I didn't have much time
to enjoy any view. I made it to the top of Wildcat D and chilled
for a few minutes at the top of the ski lift. Climbing one of the
lift towers for a better view, I thought about how Wildcat D reminds
me of Elk Mountain back home. It's a ski mountain and the best
view is from atop the lift.

Once I was done at the top, I **ran** down and booked it to
Franconia Notch!

Meeting my family in just the nick of time, we boarded the
cable car and began up. Like the rest of Franconia Notch, it
was gorgeous! The view at the top was much better than at
Wildcat, especially in the evening sun. We summited Cannon as
a family and enjoyed the leisurely trip down.
