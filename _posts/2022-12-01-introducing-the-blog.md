title: "Introducing: The Blog!"

I've been hard at work on my site's newest feature: the blog!


This is mainly intended to serve as a hiking and adventure journal,
so stay tuned for some cool stories! I've already written about some
past hikes for you read through. Please keep in mind, these stories
won't be the most enthralling or detailed due to them being written
as much as two years after the fact. Either way, I'm excited for you
all to enjoy the blog and see what's to come!

The blog is accessible at [/blog]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/blog)
in your web browser, or as an [Atom feed]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml).
