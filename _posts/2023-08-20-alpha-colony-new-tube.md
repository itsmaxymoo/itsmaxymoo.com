title: Giving the Alpha Colony a new Test Tube

After moving into my new college dorm, I noticed the Alpha
Colony's water turned a grapefruit red color. This is indicative of
a bacteria bloom, one that can make the ants sick. I made a new test tube
setup for them using distilled water this time; the tap water from
the previous tube may have lead to the impurities and subsequent bacteria
bloom. They were *pissed* after I transferred them, but I believe it will
be beneficial in the long run. This new tube will hopefully last them
through diapause.
