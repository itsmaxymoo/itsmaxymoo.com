- name: Catskill 3500
  description: The Catskills are a sprawling mountain range east of Binghamton, New York.
    The Catskill 3500 challenge is well known by many as it attempts to summit the
    largest peaks in the range, but it has some quirks. It used to be that there were
    thirty-five 3500' peaks, quite easy to remember, but an updated geological
    survey revealed that Rocky Mountain was actually slightly shorter than 3500'.
    More recently, two of the peaks, Graham and Doubletop, each located on private
    property, were closed to the public permanently. This brings the list of true,
    climbable 3500'ers down to 32. This list contains 33, as it still includes Rocky Mountain.
