After several weeks in my dorm windowsill, Nittany Jar is looking fantastic and
filled with diverse life! It has a health population of fully aquatic isopods,
snails, and sewage worms, as well as many other micro-animals. I believe it also has some
kind of micro shrimp and a glass worm/slug.

This jar has impressed me so much that I have decided to open and aerate it periodically,
and even clean the glass, all in an attempt to maintain equilibrium. It's too pretty
to run as an experiment!

In the past 2 days the isopods have chewed through the stem of the plant and now
their food source is floating at the top; they're cute, not smart! Luckily it was
pretty trivial to push the plant back into the dirt. It will die now of course,
but the pods will still have food while I source a new plant.
