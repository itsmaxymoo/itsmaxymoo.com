Writing this two years after the fact, this was my first time ever
climbing a serious mountain. Previously, my only experience hiking
had been around Pennsylvania. Unsurprisingly, I was not expecting
the difficulty and rigor commonly found in the Adirondacks!

I set out in my 2002 Subaru Outback with three nearly bald tires
for Lake Placid, NY. My plan for the week was to hit up the daks,
meander over to New Hampshire, and finish by climbing Mount
Washington... Eating only Cliff Bars.
