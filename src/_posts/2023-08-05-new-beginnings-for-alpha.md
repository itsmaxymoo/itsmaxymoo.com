The Alpha Jar is coming along great!
Its fern has grown to about 3 inches in height
and is beginning to unroll. There are little blades
of grass popping up, and some deeper thicker
roots forming visible near the bottom.

The ants have mysteriously moved their brood
out of public view. Whether or not they ate the
brood or are even alive is currently unknown.
I have not seen any other animal life in this jar
at the time of observing.
