I made {{ page.title }} to add some life to my dorm room! The jar was made
from a swamp east of campus. Like seemingly all areas of Pennsylvania, this jar
has a healthy population of sewage worms. I found an interesting aquatic
plant not found back home for the jarrarium, and to my surprise the mud came
with an isopod-like aquatic bug colony!
