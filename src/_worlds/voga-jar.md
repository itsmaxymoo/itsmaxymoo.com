My mom had a Voga wine bottle laying around collecting
dust for many years. She allowed me to use it for a jarrarium,
but I kept the Voga label on because she likes it!
The wine bottle allows for a very unique looking environment
indeed! I created {{ page.title }} because I thought the tall,
skinny bottle was cool, and I also wanted a second aquatic
jar. Compared to {% include world/link.html world="beta-jar" %},
{{ page.title }}'s soil is much sandier and there is **much** less
debris. Starting out, the only vegetation you can see are the
two live plants I put in.

{{ page.title }} admittedly may have a better chance surviving
long term in comparison to {% include world/link.html world="beta-jar" %}
due to {% include world/link.html world="beta-jar" %}'s extreme
amount of dead debris. Who will win?
