## Beta Jar

{% include image.html tag="beta-jar-5-august-2023" basic=true %}

Beta Jar is sadly looking much less vibrant than before. The duckweed
at the top has lost most of its color, and no aquatic life can be spotted
swimming about.
The water has become murkier, and the soil whiter. The soil appears to be
expanding upwards slowly as the air bubbles reach for freedom.

## Voga

Voga is looking much nicer as an albeit younger jar. The aquatic plant mass
has nearly doubled since creation. The soil is experiencing similar expansion
as described with Beta Jar. The initial party worms are nowhere to be found,
except trails where they dug through the sand visible beneath the glass.
There is a small film forming across the top.
