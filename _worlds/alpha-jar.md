{{ page.title }} is my first attempt at an ecosphere!
I collected dirt from my local forrest and threw it in a
1-gallon canning jar, sprayed it with some water, and
sealed it. I am admittedly concerned for the long term
success of this ecosphere because it has an (accidental)
partial ant colony. I'm concerned they will consume other
lifeforms in the jar until it is thrown out of balance.
Time will tell!
